# GradioBot

I am a history professor and not a developer. I taught myself python last year so I could explore the new AI releases. I am far from an experienced python programmer. Hopefully you professionals will forgive places where the code is clunky or not as elegant as it could be. The bottom line is this app does what I want it to do and I'll just leave it right there.

The app uses the gradio library to display a simple page for testing Stable Diffusion 3. As far as I can tell everything you can select has been included. You can run the app from the command line using python3. You should create a virtual environment. If you don't know how to do that I'll leave it up to you to figure it out. I did so I'm guessing you can too. You will need to have installed the gradio api and a couple of other libraries listed in requirements.txt. You can install them using "pip install -r requirements.txt".

It's a humble little app and SD3 seems to be an awesome model. I can't wait for it to be released. I hope the app is useful to you.

Have fun!
